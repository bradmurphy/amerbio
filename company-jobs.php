                    American BioOptics is a dynamic, medical device startup company that is developing a novel optical technology for the screening and diagnosis of colon cancer for the 90M Americans (nearly 1 in 3 people) over age 50 who should regularly screen for colon cancer. Using ground-breaking optical backscattering technology developed at Northwestern University that is sensitive to the earliest biological changes shown to be associated with colon cancer, American BioOpticsâ€™ provides new hope for colon cancer screening with a goal to provide <span class="mobile-copy">an accurate, minimally invasive, office-based screening test that does not require bowel preparation and that will forever change the way we screen for colon cancer. American BioOptics owns a solid intellectual property portfolio and has extensive and ongoing clinical trial work on this promising new approach. We seek motivated, bright people to grow with us and to help define how this innovative technology will impact our markets and improve the quality and duration of human life.</span>
