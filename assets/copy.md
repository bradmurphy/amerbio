American BioOptics, LLC, With Evanston Northwestern Healthcare, Receives STTR Award from National Institutes of Health

Funding Will Advance Research in Biomedical Optics to Improve Detection Rates of Pre-Cancerous Polyps During Colonoscopy

Evanston, IL, February 19, 2008 — American BioOptics (ABO), in conjunction with Evanston Northwestern Healthcare, received on September 28, 2007, a Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) award from the National Institutes of Health. The award enables ABO to perform clinical trials using its advanced biomedical optics technology, which can identify patients at risk for colon cancer, and has the potential of improving the effectiveness of the millions of colonoscopies performed each year.
Colonoscopy has traditionally been used to identify polyps which can develop into colon cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths among Americans. Evidence suggests that up to 10% of large polyps are missed during this widely established screening test.
ABO and Evanston Northwestern Healthcare are hoping to improve the performance of colonoscopy with the development of a novel biomedical optics technology, called Early Increase in Blood-Supply (EIBS). EIBS looks at the surface cells of the colon to identify areas that show increased blood supply, a possible indicator of the presence of nearby polyps. When used in conjunction with traditional colonoscopy, EIBS could guide physicians to polyps that would otherwise be overlooked. Andrew Cittadine, CEO of American BioOptics believes, “The EIBS technology could have major importance for colon cancer prevention efforts in the United States. With the aid of EIBS during colonoscopy, physicians may find additional polyps, which could save lives.”
The STTR award follows on the heels of a National Science Foundation Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) award given to the company in June of this year. Both awards are granted by the federal government to small domestic companies conducting innovative research or research and development that has potential for commercialization and public benefit. American BioOptics has qualified for a STTR Fast-Track award, which provides Phase 1 and 2 funding to the company simultaneously.
American BioOptics is a medical device company located in Chicago, Illinois. The company is working to revolutionize colon cancer screening, and eventually other cancers, with a highly accurate, minimally invasive test based on a novel light scattering technology platform.

# _product ===============================

The Product

Individuals at risk for colon cancer often go undetected, until it's too late.

col-1
The statistics are grim: colorectal canceris the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. More than 150,000 men and women are affected each year. More surprisingly, those who are diagnosed often have no familyhistory of colon cancer, or other identifiable risk factors.

col2
Today colonoscopy is the reliable standard for cancer identification. Regular screening can, in many cases, prevent colorectal cancer altogether. Yet, for reasons both practical and personal, colonoscopy remains underutilized. Research shows that more than half of those who should get screened, don’t.

Our Vision
American BioOptics (ABO) envisions a different future — a simple population screening test, providing a more accurate and infinitely more acceptable model for colorectal screening.

Improved Cancer Screenings
A non-invasive test could greatly simplify the screening process for colorectal cancer. Using a small probe that is inserted just inside the rectum, we envision a test that would be easily administered by a patient’s physician, identifying those patients at high risk for cancer and in need of additional follow-up.
American BioOptics believes that such a test, which would use proprietary optical technology, has the potential to be:
    +  Office-based
    +  Inexpensive
    +  No-prep, and
    +  Highly accurate

Development Process
The research team at American BioOptics is committed to innovation. Working in collaboration with Northwestern University and Evanston Northwestern Healthcare, the team has already completed and published a significant amount of early clinical work and begun product development.

Initial results show a high degree of sensitivity and specificity of this non-invasive screening test. Over the next several years, ABO will perform extensive clinical trials, which will lead to an FDA submission and eventual product commercialization.

ABO looks forward to the future, when its technology will save thousands of lives by becoming the first population-wide initial screening test for colorectal cancer.

Participate
American BioOptics is not actively soliciting participants for trials at this time, though we welcome your interest. If you would like to learn more about our company or if you are interested in future technology trials, please contact us at:

# _product - clinical trial data ==============================================
Clinical Trial Data
The Sensitivity and Specificity of the trials were 100% and 64%, respectively.

Trial results
col-1
The American BioOptics team has performed both animal and human clinical trials with a primary focus on colon cancer. Published trials to date include a pilot study involving 63 average risk patients undergoing screening colonoscopy at Evanston Northwestern Healthcare, as well as animal trials on rats and mice.

Sensitivity	100%

Specificity	64%

Optical detection of advanced polyp (adenoma >1 cm) vs. colonoscopy (n=63) from single rectal measurement

col2
These early results are remarkable, when compared to clinically available FOBT and fecal DNA analyses, which have sensitivities of 10.8% and 18.2%, respectively.	Ongoing trials are actively improving upon these initial results.

Both the animal and human clinical trials show the ability of optical technology to predict cancer risk well before the earliest observable changes in the cells’ histology. In addition, results of the human trials showed, for the first time, the ability of ABO’s optical technology to predict risk of advanced polyps throughout the colon in both experimental colorectal cancer models and humans.

Preventing Colorectal Cancer
Colorectal cancer screening saves lives. Screening can find precancerous polyps — abnormal growths in the colon or rectum — so that they can be removed before turning into cancer. Screening also helps find colorectal cancer at an early stage, when treatment often leads to a cure.
(Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

Screening Technologies
 col-1
 There are a few important things you can do now to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in the future.
The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends one of the following screening technologies for men and women, aged 50 and older:
    +  Colonoscopy
    +  Sigmoidoscopy
    +  Fecal occult blood test (FOBT)
    +  Double-contrast barium enema

col2
Individuals with certain risk factors should begin screening earlier or have screening more often. Talk to your doctor about your own risk and when you should have screening tests.

The Technology
Our cancer screening platform begins with asingle focus — To create an office-based, no-prep,non-invasive screening test that can identify patients athigh risk for cancer.

A New Method for Screening
col-1
American BioOptics is pioneering a new method to screen for colon cancer through the development of a minimally intrusive optical diagnostic test. Developed with substantial research funding from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, the company’s novel optical technology shines light inside the colon and analyzes how the reflected light interacts with the lining of the colon.  This interaction provides unique insight into

col2
abnormalities in healthy appearing tissue that are too small to be seen with an endoscope or microscope. Such subtle changes, including an increase in blood flow to the surface cells lining the colon and changes in the architecture of the cells themselves, can be assessed from the rectum and have been linked to an increased risk of cancer in our early human studies.

Low Coherence Enhanced Backscatter (LEBS)
There are a few important things you can do now to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in the future.
The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends one of the following screening technologies for men and women, aged 50 and older:
    +  LEBS is sensitive to changes in 	intracellular organization that are 	otherwise undetectable by histology.
    +  LEBS signals mostly depend on the 	second-order scattering of weakly 	localized photons by tissue structures. 	This contrast mechanism is unique to 	LEBS and cannot be probed by existing 	techniques.
    +  LEBS enables physicians and 	technicians to identify potential risk for 	the development of cancer and its 	progression by sensing changes in 	histologically normal-appearing tissue 	at a distance from a cancerous lesion.

col2
Four-dimensional Elastic Light-Scattering Fingerprinting (ELF)
This technology obtains comprehensive data from photons undergoing single light scattering in tissue. ELF-based techniques have been shown to allow precise localization of polyps during colonoscopy through an endoscopically compatible probe. 4-D ELF allows acquisition of light-scattering data in several dimensions. These include wavelength of light, the scattering angle, azimuthal angle of scattering and polarization of scattered light.
