                    American BioOptics uses a platform of complementary light-scattering screening technologies to identify manifestations of field carcinogenesis â€” a well-established biological phenomenon that suggests subtle and detectable abnormalities occur throughout an organ when cancer is present nearby.

                    We can identify field carcinogenesis with outstanding accuracy with our technology, a sophisticated platform of unique, patented light scattering technologies that allow characterization of the nanoscale architecture of the cell, and can be sensitive to particles 10-20 times smaller than seen with conventional light microscope.

                    This technology obtains comprehensive data from photons undergoing single light scattering in tissue. ELF-based techniques have been shown to allow precise localization of polyps during colonoscopy through an endoscopically compatible probe. 4-D ELF allows acquisition of light-scattering data in several dimensions. These include wavelength of light, the scattering angle, azimuthal angle of scattering and polarization of scattered light.
